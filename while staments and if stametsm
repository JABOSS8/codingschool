HW 1
Write a code that prints the whole numbers from 1 to 100 each on a separate line, BUT, for multiples of three, print “Fizz”, and for multiples of five print “Buzz” instead of the number. . For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz” instead.

  ##Check if x is a multiple of 3
