#You can use the print() function to print text and numbers to the terminal (black space on the right)
##Strings, or words letters and symbols, must be put in quotes ("") to be able to be print
##Numbers are considered a different data type than strings, and such must be cast using the str() function
##To combine a string and a number, use the + operator
##Example: print("my favorite number is" + str(8))

print("&&&")
print("& &")
print("&&&")
