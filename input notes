CASTING NOTES

For several reasons we will occasionally have to change the type of our variables. Sometimes an integer needs to become a String to be printable; sometimes a String needs to become an integer to do math.

Casting a variable called x to an integer
x = in
Casting a variable called x to a String 
y = str(y)

Casting a variable called x to a float
z = float(z)

#EXAMPLES FOR CREATING A SIMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT 
#CODE

#Create a variable x that takes user input with the prompt "Please enter an integer "
x = input ("please enter an integer")


#Cast x into an integer
x = int(x)

#Multiply it by 3
x = (x * 3)

#Display result
print(x)

James A's example of input
x = input ("please enter a number")
x = int(x)
x = (x * 3)
print(x)
'''

#Create a variable x that takes user input with the prompt "Please enter an integer "times it by three then do x * y a str then enter a number for y

##Create variable x, using input, with the prompt "please enter an integer"
x = input("Please enter an integer \n")

##Convert to an integer
x = int(x)

##Create variable y, using input to get a number that is a string 
y = input("Please enter another number")

##Print x * y
print( x * y)
