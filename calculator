'''
INTERACTIVE CALCULATOR PROJECT

You will be making an interactive calculator that allows a user to choose one of four operations -- adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Once the user has chosen the operation they want to perform, they must enter two numbers with which to perform the operation. Further, a user will be prompted to choose which operation to perform and then prompted what numbers they want to use. Then, the calculator you code will print the result.


For reference, python symbols

switch = 1

while(switch == 1):

  ##First, prompt the user to choose whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide, and store that input into a variable called op.
  op = input("please choose one of the symbols * + / -")


  ## Then, use if statements to identify the type of operation used. Within each if statement, prompt the user to enter additional numbers. I will do the addition version of this first as an example.

  #Check if op is addition
  if (op == "+"):
    #Prompt user to enter the first number to add. Store it in a variable called add1.
    add1 = float(input("Please enter a number"))

    #Prompt user to enter the second number to add. Store it in a variable called add2.   
    add2 = float(input("Please enter a number"))

    #Then, add the two numbers and store it in a result called summ
    summ = add1 + add2

    #Finally, print the result
    print(summ)

    
  if (op == "-"):
    subtract1 = float(input("please enter a number"))
    subtract2  = float(input("please enter a number"))
    difference = subtract1 - subtract2
    print(difference)
    

  if (op =='*'):
    multiply1 = float(input("please enter a number"))
    multiply2 = float(input("please enter a number"))
    prouduct = multiply1 * multiply2
    print(prouduct)


  if (op =='/'):
    divide1 = float(input("please enter a number"))
    divide2 = float(input("please enter a number"))

    ##if divide2 is equal to 0, prompt them to enter a number for divide2 again
    if (divide2 == 0 ):
      divide2 = float(input("please enter another number that is not 0"))
    
    quotient = divide1/divide2 
     
    print(quotient)

  option = input("Do you want to perform another function? Type yes to continue, or type anything to quit")
  
  if(option != "yes"):
    switch = 0
