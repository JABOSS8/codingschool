#Variables are created when they are first assigned values.
#The value associated to a variable can be updated to a new value when used in an expression.
#Variables must be declared in expressions.

#counter = 100   #integer
#miles = 1000.0  #float
#name = "John"   #string

#print(counter)
#print(miles)
#print(name)

#changing = 3
#print(changing)
#changing = 9
#print(changing)

#red = 5
#blue = 10
#print(red, blue)

#yellow = red
#print(yellow, red, blue)

#a = b = c = 1

#print(a,b,c)

#a, b, c = 1, 2, "John"

#print(a,b,c)


###RULES FOR VARIABLE NAMES###
#Names cannot start with a number
#There can be no spaces in the name; you use _ instead if you want to separate terms
#Can't use the following for variable names: ' " <>, / ? | \ () ! @  # $ % & * - +
# It's considered best practice that names are lowercase
#Variable names should be Python reseved like with, if, not, and, and son.

#x = None
#print(x)


#var1 = 1
#var2 = 10
#var3 = 4E2

#print(float(2))
#print(int(2.0))

#print(4+2)
#print(4*2)
#print(4**2) #The ** means raising the number on the left to the power of the number on the right

#print (1+1 ) #adding an integer to an integer yields an integer
#print(1+1.0) #adding an integer to a float yields a float

#print(9/3) #using a single slash here yields a float
#print(9//3) #using a double slash here yields an integer

#print('I am a single quoted string')
#print("I am a double quoted string")
#print("""I am a triple quoted string""")

#print("So I said, \"You don't know me \"")
#print('So I said, \"You don\'t know me.\"')
#print("""This statement will only have three backslashes: \\ \\ \\""")

#print("I want to have a long space, also known as a tab,\tin this sentence.")
#print("I want this single print statement\nto print on two lines.")


#s = "Hello" 
#print(s[0]) #Prints H, because it accesses the 0th term in the string

#s = ["dog", 1, [3,4]]
#print(s[2][1])


##Boolean
#size = 1
#print(size < 1)



##Print a string: He said "I'll go later"
#Use single quotes, double quotes, and triple quotes
#print('He said \"I\'ll go later\"')
#print("He said \"I\'ll go later\"")
#print("""He said \"I\'ll go later\"""")



#Create three different variables called name, age, and salary.
#Assign name with your own name
#Assign age with your own age
#Assign salary with 3000.50
#Print them on separate lines
#name = "James"
#age = 11
#salary = 3000.50
#print(name)
#print(age)
#print(salary)




#Create a variable called temperature and assign it with 45
#Consider 45 to be in fahrenheit
#Using only the variable temperature, convert temperature to celsius value.
#Formula: celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
#Once you have converted temperature, print temperature to screen.
#temperature = 45
#temperature = (temperature - 32) * 5 / 9
#print (temperature)


###Write what you think the sample outputs will be
#A
#spam = 2
#eggs = 3
#eggs = 4
#spam = 5
#print("A:\n" + str(spam * eggs))

#20


#B
#x= 5
#y = 7
#print("B:\n" + str(x+y))

#12


#C -- be careful!
#x = 2
#X = 4
#print("X = " + str(x))
#print("x = " + str(X))

#X = 2
#x = 4


#Write a print statement to say "Hello!"
#A: print("Hello!")

#What is 2**5?
#A: 32

#What is 6 % 2?
#A: 0

#What is (True and False) and True
##(False) and True
###A: False

#What is the catch-all for conditions not specified?
#Translation: When you're using an if statement, what ELSE can you use following the if statement?
#A: else

#What does the # symbol mean?
#A: comment

#What does the following code do?
#print("xyz" * 2)
#xyzxyz
